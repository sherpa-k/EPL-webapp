### Description
The English Premier League is one of the most popular and respected leagues in the world. There are a total of 20 teams in the league that face each other twice a year, one at home and the other away. In the web app script below, we use reactive programming to gather data on two user selected teams. We find the two weeks in which they played and gather the half time and full time goal count for each game. We also have a comparitive model to describe the performance of the two teams to the rest of the league in a scatterplot that shows the goals scored to goals allowed ratio. 


The built web app can also be found on the shiny server here at this [link](https://kalsangsherpa.shinyapps.io/1819EPLMatchInfo/)
